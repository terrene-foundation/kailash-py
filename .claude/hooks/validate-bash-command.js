  // the code says "halt", the runtime does not halt.

  // because the earliest of the five (the cross-repo ceremony, immediately
  // below) sits ABOVE the `deferredScopeAdvisory` declaration.

  // caught on the first three fixes (see withScopeAdvisory below).
  //
  // Severity is the MAX of {deferred, result}: a `block` below always wins and
  // is never weakened, and a deferred `halt-and-report` is never downgraded to
  // a bare advisory. A legacy `{continue:true, message}` result carries no
  // severity, so its message rides out as a trailing report line rather than
  // being dropped when a finding is pending.
  //
  // loom#1715 H-1 — the ALL-PRE-ACTION carve-out. The collapse-to-
  // `halt-and-report` default renders the head "the action ALREADY RAN", which
  // is FALSE for every finding this hook emits: it is a PreToolUse hook, so
  // nothing has run when it speaks. The carve-out is deliberately the NARROWEST
  // that fixes the measured case — it fires only when EVERY finding in the merge
  // is `pre-action`, so any pre-existing combination (which contains no
  // `pre-action` finding at all) still collapses to `halt-and-report` and every
  // existing head renders byte-identically. That is measured, not assumed:
  // ci-cost-reach.test.mjs pins the cross-repo finding's rendered head against a
  // snapshot taken before this change.
  //
  // THE RESIDUAL IS STATED, AND IT IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL — it was MEASURED on the
  // second of the two commands this surface targets:
  //   git push origin HEAD  -> "NOT BLOCKED — the action has NOT run yet..."  (fixed)
  //   gh pr create ...      -> "NOT BLOCKED — the action ALREADY RAN..."      (residual)
  // `gh pr create` ALWAYS co-fires the PCF-category finding above, which is
  // registered `halt-and-report`, so the merge collapses and the CI-cost
  // delivery inherits the false head on that path. Every other deferred finding
  // in this PreToolUse hook carries the same mis-registration — nothing has run
  // when this hook speaks — so the general repair is to re-register them, and
  // that is deliberately NOT done here: those findings ship from other lanes
  // (the PCF block is at origin/main, from T5), and silently changing another
  // lane's delivered head is a wider blast radius than this fix is scoped to

  // Edit/Write tool writes remain fenced by the settings.json Edit/Write+path
  // deny rules + posture-gate + integrity-guard. Pattern adopted from a
  // downstream state-file-write-guard (issue #25, c0aeff73).
  //
  // Protected paths:

  // heredoc bypassed BOTH the deny matrix (no cat: entry) AND the Layer-1
  // redirect detector — same Bash-redirect mutation vector that motivates

  // bypassed the signing invariant and injected an unsigned, unattributable

  // upgrade evidence ("logged as positive observation"), but that upgrade path is
  // AND-gated on a human challenge-nonce the agent cannot mint (Rule 5 #4), so the
  // durable harm is attribution-signal corruption, NOT self-promotion (R1

  // `node -e "fs.writeFileSync('.claude/operators.roster.schema.json', <weakened>)"`
  // bypassed the Bash layer and could silently relax the trust-root contract
  // (drop propertyNames prototype-pollution rejection, relax the GPG-fingerprint

  // Edit/Write (fenced by integrity-guard's codify-branch+lease) and /sync —

  // file-tool layer for ALL state files at once, with no trace — the same shape as
  // the operators.roster.schema.json weakening one level up (the deny CONTRACT, not
  // a guarded file). UNCONDITIONAL flat add, empirically validated SAFE against
  // over-block (build-spec §L2): the ONLY legitimate Bash writer is
  // `node .claude/bin/reconcile-settings-deny.mjs --write .claude/settings.json`,

  //       control (it BLOCKS at integrity-guard, so the harness demonstrably has
  //       teeth). An Edit-tool write IS a deliberate agent write, and it is the EASIER
  //       path of the two. Do not read "deliberate agent-write vector" as closed.
  //   (b) The ACCIDENT vector #1399's prose motivates (a mis-merged / mis-synced
  //       VERSION). An accidental copy arrives via `git merge` or a sync script —
  //       NEITHER a Bash tool call NOR an Edit tool call — so no agent-write fence can
  //       see it, and BOTH fences #1399 prescribes are agent-write fences. That vector
  //       needs a CROSS-CHECK (class vs manifest), not a fence, and is tracked as
  //       #1402: `emit.mjs` already carries one (`_classifyManifestPresence` + the
  //       owner-class absence throw), but `emit-cli-artifacts.mjs` and `emit-coc.mjs`
  //       carry NEITHER — measured 0 / 0 against `emit.mjs`'s 3 / 3, so the greps are
  //       known-good.
  //
  // Worth doing regardless: against someone who can already write VERSION this is a
  // CONCENTRATION of trust rather than a new privilege (they could usually write
  // sync-manifest.yaml too), but a deliberate write here silently converts Validator 15,
  // V17's half B, and V16's presence classifier into no-ops and prints GREEN. Nothing
  // re-derives VERSION, so it is non-fold-derived authority state and KEEPS block at
  // Layer 3 (LAYER3_BLOCK_RX below), same disposition as posture.json / settings.json.
  //
  // PROSE-FP EXPOSURE — the ratified MUST-2 deviation's premise is WEAKEST here, and
  // this add makes it weaker. The Layer-3 `block` is permitted by the deviation recorded
  // in state-file-write-guard.md § "Severity by layer", whose stated justification is
  // that these paths carry "prose-FP risk ~0". That premise has ALREADY been found false
  // once (#1363) and repaired. VERSION is the most-mentioned of the protected set —
  // measured over `.claude/**/*.md` at this commit with
  // `grep -rF "<path>" .claude --include='*.md'` (count / distinct files):
  //
  //     .claude/VERSION                86 / 24      <- this add
  //     .claude/settings.json          63 / 28
  //     .claude/learning/posture.json  21 / 15
  //
  // (An earlier review reported 56/18, 23/14, 11/10 for the same three. The ORDER is
  // stable, the magnitudes are not — the two runs used different corpora and neither
  // stated its scope. Re-derive with the command above rather than trusting either set;
  // the point is the ordering, not the multiplier.)
  //
  // Consequence: the two over-block residuals reached the most-documented path in the
  // corpus. BOTH WERE ADDRESSED IN loom#1703 — this block is the historical record of
  // WHY, kept because the reasoning is the load-bearing part; the current dispositions
  // live in state-file-write-guard.md § "Known residuals" (k)/(l):
  //   (k) CLOSED (Bash lane). A write to a THROWAWAY sandbox path ending in a protected
  //       basename used to flag at Layers 1/2/3 because the detector had no notion of
  //       WHICH repo root a state path belonged to. It now resolves the matched TOKEN
  //       through `lib/state-target-scope.js` and decides on the CANONICAL form —
  //       in-tree blocks, out-of-tree passes, unresolvable blocks and SAYS it could not
  //       resolve. The Edit/Write lane half (`guard-path-scope.js`) is still open.
  //   (l) PARTIALLY CLOSED. A heredoc report that merely QUOTES a write command as an
  //       EXAMPLE no longer flags at Layers 1/2: a heredoc body is not shell text, so
  //       inert bodies are blanked in the STRUCTURE view those two layers read. Layer 3
  //       is deliberately NOT masked (that would delete a real control), so a body
  //       quoting an INTERPRETER + a write token still flags. Both halves are pinned by
  //       assertions in test-harness/tests/state-target-scope-1703.test.mjs.
  //
  // This was never theoretical and the #1399 shard's own review paid it twice: residual
  // (l) blocked three independent actors in ONE round, every one while VERIFYING this
  // guard, and the adversarial reviewer of that PR could not run its symlink-containment
  // attack at all because (k) fenced the sandbox path it needed to stage in. That attack
  // is now a committed test (FLOOR 2 in the suite above), which is the concrete measure
  // of what closing (k) bought.
  //
  // OVER-BLOCK measured, then removed (the one legitimate Bash-lane writer class): a
  // 15-command legitimate corpus was run through the REAL detector under this regex
  // before/after. 13/15 unaffected — `cat`/`jq -r`/`grep`/`diff`/`shasum`/`git add`/
  // `git show`/a `:(exclude)` pathspec/a read-only `node -e`/prose in a `--body` or
  // `-m`/the `stamp-template-version.mjs --write --worktree <wt>` stamper (which never
  // puts the literal path on the command line, exactly like the sanctioned
  // `reconcile-settings-deny.mjs --write` writer). The 2 that DID newly flag are the
  // same shape: `/migrate`'s snapshot + `--rollback` restore both `cp` the file, which
  // fires Layer 2 (`cp`) because Layer 2 is DIRECTION-BLIND — `pathRx.test(line)` matches
  // the path in the SOURCE position identically to the DESTINATION, so even the snapshot
  // (a pure READ) blocks. That is a property of the shared Layer-2 branch for all 11
  // pre-existing paths, not something this add introduces; narrowing it to
  // destination-position would change the predicate for every protected path and owes its
  // own shard.
  //
  // Resolved at the CALLER, by DOMAIN not by instance: the two EXECUTABLE sites are in
  // `skills/30-claude-code-patterns/multi-cli-migration.md` — the Step-1 snapshot (~:162)
  // and the `--rollback` restore (~:567) — and both now hold the path in a VARIABLE on its
  // OWN line, so no single line carries both a Layer-2 verb and the literal path. That is
  // the licensed-writer idiom this guard's own rule doc blesses (`state-file-write-guard.md`
  // § "Known residuals" (a) var-indirect / (c) by-path ceremony — the mechanism
  // `/whoami --register` and `/certify` rely on BY DESIGN), and it is already the idiom the
  // rollback block's `$p` loop uses for its other 9 paths. `commands/migrate.md` Steps 1 +
  // --rollback carry PROSE only ("Copy … into `.pre-migrate.bak/`"); their prose now names
  // the variable form so an agent does not re-derive the blocking `cp`.
  // `bin/repin-downstream.mjs:479` stages via `shMaybe("git", ["add", …])` — an in-process
  // execFileSync, never a Bash tool call — so it is unaffected, as is the whole hook-writer
  // class (`version-utils.js` SessionStart auto-create ~:308 + type auto-correct ~:519).
  // All 13 adversarial write vectors (redirect/append/force-clobber/tee/sed -i/jq -i/
  // heredoc/rm/mv/truncate/node -e/python -c/perl -e) newly FLAG.
  //
  // NOT added to reconcile-settings-deny.mjs::CANONICAL_STATE_DENY — DELIBERATE, see the
  // § "#1399 — why VERSION is NOT in this list" block there. Unlike every entry in that
  // list, `.claude/VERSION` has TWO Edit/Write-TOOL writers on documented HAPPY paths
  // (`/sync-from-template` Step 6, which runs at every downstream consumer on every
  // pull and is dispositive alone; and `/migrate` Step 2), plus one on a HALT path
  // (`/codify` Step 7c's operator-facing self-service fix — listed for completeness,
  // not load-bearing). A flat `Edit()` deny would break the happy-path two — the same
  // reason settings.json's own L1 blanket deny is omitted. Exact verbatim citations
  // live at the declining site; do not re-derive them from memory.
  // The Bash lane (here) is the half that closes with no legitimate casualty.
  // CASE-INSENSITIVE (`i`) IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT COSMETIC — and the same flag is
  // required on LAYER3_BLOCK_RX and COORD_MODE_RX below (all three are independent
  // path matchers over the same protected-state concept; a new fail-closed dimension
  // MUST land at EVERY surface in the same change per security.md § Enforcement-Surface
  // Parity — fixing only this one would leave the Layer-3 block-set and the
  // coordination-mode fence still defeatable by the identical form).
  //
  // On a case-INSENSITIVE filesystem (APFS default on macOS — the default dev
  // platform for this corpus) `.claude/version` and `.claude/VERSION` are THE SAME
  // FILE, so a case-SENSITIVE matcher is defeated by a one-character change.
  // MEASURED against the real hook before this fix, canonical vs case-variant
  // (exit 2 = blocked, 0 = passed):

  //     operators.roster  canonical=2  variant=0     .CLAUDE/ dir-case canonical=2  variant=0
  //
  // 6/6 canonical controls blocked (anti-vacuity), 6/6 variants passed. FOUR of these
  // (settings/posture/violations/roster) reproduce on origin/main @ 91453fe2 and are
  // therefore PRE-EXISTING, not introduced by #1399 — owned here regardless per
  // zero-tolerance.md Rule 1a (a finding on a PR scan is treated identically to one on
  // a main scan; "same on main" is NOT a deferral). The forged writes this re-closes are
  // the ones this file's own § SCOPE calls non-fold-derived: a forged posture.json is a
  // trusted L5 grant, a wiped violations.jsonl evades cumulative downgrade.
  //
  // FALSE-POSITIVE COST, MEASURED not assumed — scope `.claude/**/*.md` at this commit,
  // as (count / distinct files): `.claude/VERSION` 97/24 and `.claude/settings.json`
  // 63/28 (canonical, already matched today) vs `.claude/version` 0/0, settings
  // case-variants 0/0, `.claude/` dir case-variants 0/0. The `i` flag therefore adds
  // ZERO new prose matches across the corpus — it does not widen the residual (l)
  // over-block that already blocked four independent actors verifying this guard.
  //
  // On a case-SENSITIVE filesystem (Linux CI) `.claude/version` IS a distinct file, so
  // there the flag is a pure (measured-zero) over-block rather than a fix. That
  // asymmetry is accepted deliberately: this hook SYNCS to consumers on mixed
  // platforms, and a guard whose protection depends on the host filesystem is worse
  // than one that over-blocks a path nobody writes.
  // STATE_PATH_RX is BUILT from the registry (see the module-scope require).

    //     forged L5 would be trusted verbatim (autonomy escalation);
    //   - .initialized gates fresh-repo-vs-corrupt — deleting it + posture.json
    //     yields a fresh-repo L5 reset (trust-posture.md MUST-2 / CRIT-4);
    //   - violations.jsonl is the cumulative-downgrade counter — a wipe evades it;
    //   - presence-mechanism.json is a standalone provisioning contract (see the
    //     block rationale ~L452), not fold-derived;
    //   - operators.roster.* / coordination-log.jsonl are committed / append-
    //     authority sources (2-of-N quorum PR / signed hash-chain).
    //   - settings.json (#1309) is the file-tool DENY CONTRACT protecting every
    //     path above; a forged strip of its permissions.deny on an OFF repo is
    //     re-derived by NO fold — the L3 drift-guard self-heals at the NEXT
    //     session-start, not at the write, so an interpreter-body strip STANDS
    //     until then (an autonomy/security downgrade), so it keeps block.
    //   - VERSION (#1399) is the repo-CLASS root of trust: readRepoClass trusts
    //     `type` VERBATIM (no signature, no cross-check) and NOTHING re-derives the
    //     file, on an ON repo or an OFF one — so a forged class STANDS and silently
    //     no-ops Validator 15 entirely, Validator 17's half B, and V16's presence
    //     classifier. Same non-fold-derived disposition as posture.json, and the
    //     failure is SILENT-GREEN rather than loud, which is what earns block here.
    // None of these are re-derived away on an OFF repo, so their Layer-3 forgery
    // would STAND — they keep block. Prose-mentions of these paths are rare (the

  // #761 (reviewer LOW-1, PR #758 redteam): coordination-mode.json is the opt-in
  // override. integrity-guard.js watches it in DIRECT (Edit/Write layer), but this
  // Bash guard did not — so on an enrolled repo a
  // `node -e "fs.writeFileSync('.claude/learning/coordination-mode.json','{\"enabled\":false}')"`
  // bypassed the Bash layer and could silently flip the substrate off.
  //
  // UNLIKE roster.schema.json above, a FLAT STATE_PATH_RX add here would OVER-BLOCK
  // a solo consumer's own Bash-lane write to coordination-mode.json (their opt-in
  // escape hatch). So THIS Bash guard is enrolled-vs-solo asymmetric, mirroring
  // integrity-guard's W1-b: block the Bash mutation ONLY when
  // isCoordinationEnabled(mainCheckout) is true; on a solo/OFF repo this guard passes
  // through (it does not block the Bash write). SCOPE NOTE: "passes through" is about
  // THIS Bash lane only — the Edit/Write file-tool lane is governed by integrity-guard's
  // DIRECT set (which is ITSELF enrolled-vs-solo asymmetric: it passes through on a
  // solo/OFF repo and blocks off-codify Edit/Write only when enrolled). #762 (2026-07-02,
  // option a) DROPPED coordination-mode.json from settings.json permissions.deny precisely
  // so the file-tool lane matches this Bash guard's conditional model: on a solo repo the
  // consumer may Edit/Write their opt-in escape hatch freely (integrity-guard passthrough,
  // no settings deny); on an enrolled repo integrity-guard's DIRECT set blocks the
  // off-codify write. Both lanes are now solo-writable / enrolled-gated — no unconditional
  // file-tool deny remains.
  //
  // The enrolled block here is DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH, not the load-bearing fence: even if a
  // `{enabled:false}` Bash write LANDS on an enrolled repo, the substrate stays ON
  // because coordination-mode.js's asymmetric-precedence predicate (_refuseLocalDisable)
  // REFUSES to honor a local {enabled:false} on an enrolled repo at resolution time.
  // This Bash guard just stops the write from landing at all. That is why fail-OPEN on
  // a resolution error is acceptable: the real fence (the precedence refusal) plus the
  // Edit/Write DIRECT-set fence both remain. We wrap isCoordinationEnabled in try/catch

  // loom#1549 HIGH-2 — this was a RAW `command.split(/(?:\|\||&&|;|\|(?!\|))/)`

  // segment: `git status\ngit reset --hard HEAD` parsed as `sub:"status"`,

  // seen. A newline is a command separator in every shell; omitting it from a
  // splitter whose whole job is "which command is this segment" made the three
  // fences below unreachable by adding one keystroke.
  //
  // The fix already existed TWICE in this tree and had not reached these lanes:
  // `parseGitInvocations` passes `newlineSeparates: true`, and so does the
  // worktree lane below.
  //
  // Comments are stripped BEFORE splitting, matching what `parseGitInvocations`
  // does with `cleaned`. Without it the splitter still fractures on a `;` inside
  // a trailing COMMENT, so `git status # x; git reset --hard` fires on a segment
  // the shell would never execute. Measured both ways: with the newline fix but
  // WITHOUT this strip, that input still reached BLOCK — the newline-aware split
  // alone does not close it, and asserting otherwise would be a comment its own
  // code could not back.
  //
  // HEREDOC BODIES ARE NOT COMMANDS, and making the split newline-aware is
  // exactly what made that bite here. Before, a `cat > f <<'EOF' … EOF` body sat
  // inside ONE segment whose leading token was `cat`, so prose was shielded by
  // accident; splitting on newlines promotes every prose LINE to a segment, and
  // a line that merely QUOTES a destructive command then parses as a real
  // invocation. Caught by this guard firing on the commit message describing
  // this very fix — the same shape the worktree lane below already documents
  // ("including a `git commit -F- <<'EOF'` commit message for this PR"). That
  // lane solved it and the solution had not reached these three; this is the
  // third such gap in this file, which is the point of #1549.

  // its Wiring booked). The stash stack is `refs/stash` plus a reflog in the

  // worktree — unlike the index and `HEAD`, which are per-worktree. A sibling's
  // `git stash pop` applies YOUR entry into ITS tree and drops it: you get a
  // merely-clean tree, the sibling gets a mutation neither authored, and BOTH
  // sides fail silently. Nothing errors, so nothing surfaces at review either.
  //
  // SEVERITY IS `pre-action`, and that is the ADVISORY class Rule 9's Wiring
  // specifies — not a strengthening of it. The `git stash` invocation IS
  // structurally visible here, but whether the repo carries linked worktrees is
  // a SECOND lookup the matcher does not itself perform, so the lexical signal
  // alone MUST NOT carry `block` (hook-output-discipline.md MUST-2). Of the two
  // non-block registers `instruct-and-wait.js` offers, `advisory` renders the
  // head "the action PROCEEDED" and `halt-and-report` renders "the action
  // ALREADY RAN" — both FALSE at PreToolUse, which is precisely the
  // mis-registration loom#1715 H-1 measured and added `pre-action` to fix. So
  // `pre-action` is the register that states an advisory PreToolUse fate
  // truthfully; the enforcement class is unchanged (non-blocking, exit 0).
  //
  // DEFERRED, never returned (the loom#1606 lesson). A `return` here would
  // suppress every fence below — including the `--no-verify` lane — for a
  // command like `git stash && git commit --no-verify`.

      //      costs nothing.
