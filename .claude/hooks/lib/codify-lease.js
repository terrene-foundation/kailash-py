/**
 * codify-lease — concurrency control for self-referential /codify runs.
 *
 * F14 M7 Shard E (workspaces/multi-operator-coc 02-plans/01-architecture.md §7.1).
 *
 * Problem: under N operators, two concurrent /codify invocations targeting the
 * same scope_files (e.g. both editing `.proposals/latest.yaml` +
 * `learning-codified.json` at once) clobber the rule corpus. The fix is a
 * structural lease that:
 *
 *   1. Names the scope deterministically (sorted, deduped relative file list).
 *   2. ALWAYS includes the codify-class state files
 *      (`learning-codified.json`, `.proposals/latest.yaml`) — even when the
 *      caller forgets, the lease covers them.
 *   3. Forces the codify session onto a `codify/<display_id>-<date>` branch so
 *      two concurrent sessions race for the branch namespace, NOT the working
 *      tree (admin-merge to main resolves the race).
 *   4. Persists an on-disk record at
 *      `.claude/learning/codify-lease.json` so a concurrent process sees the
 *      conflict and EXITS with a typed error (no silent fallback per
 *      rules/zero-tolerance.md Rule 3).
 *   5. Refuses to acquire when the workspace is dirty in a way that would
 *      conflict with the codify edits (an early gate, with a clear message
 *      naming the conflicting paths).
 *
 * Style: CommonJS to match sibling lib/* modules. Pure node:fs / child_process,
 * no external deps. The lease file lives alongside posture state (resolved via
 * state-resolver.js) so worktree-isolated /codify runs still see the same
 * lease as the main checkout.
 *
 * NOT this module's job:
 *   - rule propagation (immediate to main — that's the orchestrator's job
 *     after admin-merge of the codify PR).
 *   - signed [ack] for MUST-clause changes (lives in trust-posture wiring
 *     consumed at SessionStart).
 *   - team-memory promotion (lives in commands/codify.md Step 4b which calls
 *     this lease + then writes the .claude/team-memory/<topic>.md files).
 *
 * Public API:
 *   acquireCodifyLease({ scopeFiles, displayId, repoDir? }) -> Result
 *     Result = { ok: true, lease: {...}, branch, leasePath, scope, record_emit }
 *           | { ok: false, error, reason, conflicting?: {...} }
 *     record_emit (FSUB 2026-06-11): result of emitting the signed
 *     `codify-lease` coordination-log record (cross-clone visibility per
 *     knowledge-convergence.md MUST-3). {ok:true, record} on success;
 *     a typed {ok:false, error, reason, step} on failure — NON-FATAL to
 *     the lease (the on-disk mutex landed), but callers MUST surface it.
 *     `reclaimed` (2026-08-04) is present ONLY when this acquire took over a
 *     lease the TTL classifier found STALE — it names the previous holder, the
 *     liveness basis, and the `record_emit` of the paired stale-takeover
 *     record. Callers MUST surface it; see § liveness/TTL below.
 *     A conflict result additionally carries `liveness` (why the lease was
 *     judged still HELD).
 *
 *   releaseCodifyLease({ repoDir?, displayId }) -> { ok, error? }
 *     The leasePath is derived from repoDir via _leasePath(_gitToplevel(repoDir))
 *     so the release path mirrors acquireCodifyLease (Sec-MED-3): callers cannot
 *     misroute the release write to another file under .claude/learning/.
 *
 *   readActiveLease(repoDir?) -> { lease | null, liveness?, stale? }
 *
 * The Result is the contract — callers branch on `ok` and surface `error`
 * + `reason` directly to the user. NO throws on expected-failure paths.

// ---- liveness / TTL ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// THE DEFECT (loom, session 9, 2026-08-04): the conflict predicate was
// `if (existing && !existing._released)` and nothing else. There is no
// SessionEnd auto-release for the codify lease (unlike claims — grep
// multi-operator-sessionend.js: it releases claims, never this lease), so the
// ONLY thing that clears it is an in-session `releaseCodifyLease` call. A
// session that crashes, is killed, or is `/clear`ed between Step 0 and release
// therefore leaves a lease that blocks EVERY subsequent /codify in the repo
// FOREVER, with no self-healing path. Observed live: one such orphan silently
// blocked an OWED /journal and had to be cleared by hand.
//
// WHAT LIVENESS SIGNAL IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE (instrument-discipline.md MUST-1 —
// name the falsifying result before citing a check as evidence):
//
//   `lease.pid` — NOT USABLE, in EITHER direction. The recorded pid is
//   `process.pid` of the process that CALLED acquireCodifyLease, and per
//   commands/codify.md Step 0 that caller is a transient `node -e` helper the
//   agent runs and which exits milliseconds later. The holding "session" is a
//   Claude Code session, not that process. Measured, not derived:
//
//       $ node -e 'const{execFileSync}=require("child_process");
//         const pid=Number(execFileSync(process.execPath,["-e",
//           "process.stdout.write(String(process.pid))"],{encoding:"utf8"}));
//         try{process.kill(pid,0);console.log("ALIVE")}
//         catch(e){console.log("DEAD("+e.code+")")}'
//       DEAD(ESRCH)
//
//   `process.kill(pid, 0)` therefore returns ESRCH for a HEALTHY lease taken
//   one second ago exactly as it does for a lease orphaned by a crash. It
//   produces the SAME result under both branches of the hypothesis, so it
//   carries zero information and is not evidence of anything. Reclaiming on it
//   would drop mutual exclusion for every lease in the repo. It is not used
//   here, and a future edit MUST NOT reintroduce it without first changing WHO
//   writes the pid.
//
//   A pid is additionally meaningless on a host other than the one that wrote
//   it, and this file carries no host identity to test that with. That is a
//   second, independent reason — but the first one alone is disqualifying.
//
//   Coordination-log heartbeats (the §4.4 reap protocol's signal, 20-min
//   LIVENESS_TTL) WOULD discriminate — but only when coordination is ENABLED
//   (a solo repo emits none), and they are keyed by `verified_id` while this
//   lease records `display_id`, so consuming them means resolving the roster
//   from inside the mutex. Deliberately NOT done here: on a coordination-off
//   repo the absence of heartbeats is indistinguishable from a dead holder,
//   which is precisely the non-discriminating shape rejected above.
//
// WHAT IS LEFT: elapsed wall-clock since `acquired_at`. It is the only signal
// this record actually carries that differs between a fresh lease and an
// abandoned one. So the TTL is the sole reclaim trigger.
//
// THE FLOOR — 12 hours. A codify lease is session-scoped: acquired at Step 0,
// released at end of session after the PR admin-merges. The floor has to exceed
// the longest plausible single /codify session (loom's are multi-hour waves,
// not multi-day) while still self-healing without human intervention. 12h
// clears a full working day of continuous codify work and still unblocks the
// next morning's session. Shorter (1h) would steal a live lease from a long
// wave; longer (72h) reproduces the "blocks forever" complaint in slow motion.
// A lease held longer than 12h whose holder never released is, by construction,
// not an in-flight codify.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED ON AMBIGUITY: an unparseable or MISSING `acquired_at`, and a
// future-dated one (clock skew, or a forged record), all yield age =
// INDETERMINATE and the lease is treated as HELD. Only a positively-computed
// age at or past the floor reclaims.

// THE JOURNAL DIRECTORIES THIS REPO ACTUALLY HAS, RESOLVED — NEVER HARDCODED.
//
// `/codify` TRIPPED ITS OWN INTEGRITY GUARD ON ITS OWN MANDATED STEP. Step 0
// tells the caller the helper "unions [the two MANDATORY_SCOPE files] into the
// scope automatically" and says nothing about a journal path; `commands/codify.md`
// § "Journal (MUST — phase-complete gate)" then REQUIRES a journal entry before
// `/codify` may be reported complete. A caller following the command LITERALLY
// acquired a lease covering two files and was then halt-and-reported by
// `integrity-guard.js` for the journal write — "no covering codify-lease record
// found in the folded coordination log" — on a step the SAME command mandates.
// The documented workaround (release → widen `scopeFiles` → re-acquire) also hits
// `scope-dirty` once the journal file is already written, forcing a
// remove/re-acquire/re-write dance to make the write genuinely covered rather
// than retroactively blessed.
//
// RESOLVED, NOT HARDCODED, because the journal directory is REPO-LAYOUT-DEPENDENT:
// repo-root `journal/` in some consumers, workspace-scoped
// `workspaces/<name>/journal/` in others, and many repos have both. The shapes
// here are the SAME ones `guard-path-scope.js::JOURNAL_ENTRY_RX` accepts — which
// is what `integrity-guard.js::isWatchedPath` gates on — so the scope covers
// exactly the paths the guard watches, no more and no less. Hardcoding one layout
// would leave the other silently uncovered, which is the defect one repo over.
//
// TRAILING SLASH IS BELT-AND-BRACES HERE, NOT LOAD-BEARING — stated as MEASURED,
// because the first draft of this comment claimed the opposite and was wrong.
// `integrity-guard.js::findCoveringLease` covers a candidate three ways: exact
// match, `s.endsWith("/") && candidate.startsWith(s)`, or a DOT-FREE bare dir
// (`!s.includes(".") && candidate.startsWith(s + "/")`). None of the prefixes
// emitted here contain a dot, so that third clause alone already covers them —
// including `workspaces/<n>/journal/.pending/0001-….md`. Measured: mutating the
// workspace entries to the bare form left both coverage cases GREEN (8/9; only the
// literal-membership case red). The slash is kept because it is the form that stays
// correct if a future journal dir ever DOES contain a dot, at which point the
// third clause stops applying and the second is the only one left.
//
// THE ROOT `journal/` IS UNCONDITIONAL, and that is deliberate rather than a
// hardcode readmitted through the back door: it is the module-level default of
// `journal-reserve.js::reserveJournalSlotSigned` (`opts.dir` defaults to
// "journal"), so a `/codify` CREATING a repo's first journal entry — the case
// where the directory does not exist to be enumerated — must still be covered.
// Workspace journal dirs are enumerated because there is no default to fall back
// on; a workspace created mid-session is the residual, and the caller can still
// pass it explicitly in `scopeFiles`.
//
// BREADTH IS FREE HERE. The lease is a whole-repo mutex — `acquireCodifyLease`
// refuses a second lease whether or not scopes overlap ("only one /codify lease is
// active at a time per repo"), and MANDATORY_SCOPE already guarantees any two
// concurrent /codify runs collide on `.proposals/latest.yaml`. So adding journal
// prefixes cannot introduce a conflict that did not already exist.
//
// MANDATORY_SCOPE ITSELF IS LEFT AT ITS TWO FILES. `knowledge-convergence.md`
// MUST-3 names that pair verbatim ("`.claude/learning/learning-codified.json` +
// `.claude/.proposals/latest.yaml`"), and the `42-certify` skill states that
// MANDATORY_SCOPE does NOT include `journal/`. Both statements stay TRUE under
// this shape, so the fix lands without a rule/skill edit that would otherwise be
// required — and MUST-3's actual property (the helper unions the mandatory scope
// automatically; callers cannot opt out) is preserved and extended, not weakened.
