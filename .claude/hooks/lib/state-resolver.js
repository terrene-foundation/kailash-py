/**
 * state-resolver — resolve trust-posture state files to the MAIN checkout, never a worktree.
 *
 * Mitigates red-team CRIT-2 (worktree state writes lost on cleanup):
 *   Worktree-isolated agents have their own cwd; if state I/O resolves against cwd,
 *   violations.jsonl writes go to the worktree's .claude/learning/ which is auto-deleted.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. CLAUDE_TRUST_STATE_DIR env var (override for tests)
 *   2. git rev-parse --git-common-dir (DETERMINISTIC main-checkout id)
 *   3. FALLBACK (common-dir unavailable/errors): superproject → worktree-list
 *      scan (excluding BOTH .claude/worktrees/ AND durable sibling worktrees)
 *   4. git rev-parse --show-toplevel (single-checkout case)
 *   5. NONE OF THE ABOVE ANSWERED — the resolution is INDETERMINATE and is
 *      flagged as such (see § INDETERMINATE below). It is NOT an answer.
 *
 * § INDETERMINATE — why exhausting the chain is not a fallback (loom#1471 F7)
 *
 *   Steps 2–4 all failing means git did not identify a main checkout: the
 *   binary would not resolve, or every probe exited non-zero (not a repo;
 *   `detected dubious ownership`; a corrupt repo; a timeout). The former shape
 *   returned `startCwd` there and called it a fallback, on the reasoning that
 *   resolving "within the caller's own cwd never widens trust". That reasoning
 *   was wrong, and resolving within cwd IS the widening. Measured:
 *
 *     PROBE   (non-repo dir):  resolveMainCheckout -> <the cwd itself>
 *                              discriminateState   -> fresh-repo-L5
 *     CONTROL (real worktree): resolveMainCheckout -> /Users/esperie/repos/loom
 *                              discriminateState   -> use-cache
 *
 *   `resolveStateDir` then points the substrate at `<cwd>/.claude/learning`,
 *   which is empty, and an empty state dir reads to `posture-v2.js`'s
 *   `fresh-repo-L5` — the MOST PERMISSIVE floor on the ladder (operative
 *   posture = min(operator, repo_floor), so an L5 floor constrains nothing).
 *   A git that could not answer therefore PROMOTED the repo floor. Same
 *   endpoint as loom#1338 ("a nuked repo pinned at L1 was handed back
 *   fresh-repo-L5"), reached through the git-resolution path rather than the
 *   symlink-probe path — `rules/security.md` § Enforcement-Surface Parity: one
 *   control, two independent validators, one of them blind.
 *
 *   So the indeterminate case is now DISTINGUISHABLE from "git said cwd is the
 *   toplevel" (both previously produced `startCwd`) and is ranked TIGHTEST by
 *   its consumers, per that same rule's fail-closed direction. `path` is still
 *   populated with `startCwd` so ~20 hook call sites keep a usable string, but
 *   `indeterminate: true` travels with it and trust-state consumers refuse.
 *
 * § F8 — gitEnv() discards `safe.directory`, and that stays (loom#1471)
 *
 *   `gitEnv()` sets GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1 + GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL/SYSTEM=devNull.
 *   git honours `safe.directory` ONLY from system/global config (deliberately —
 *   repo-local config is attacker-controlled), so it is discarded here, and on a
 *   differently-owned checkout (container bind-mount, CI runner, shared clone)
 *   every probe fatals with `detected dubious ownership`.
 *
 *   DECISION: keep discarding it; do NOT restore global config and do NOT pass
 *   `-c safe.directory=*`. Restoring global config reopens the entire
 *   attacker-config class this module exists to close. `safe.directory=*` is
 *   narrower but still lets git read the repo-LOCAL config of a foreign-owned
 *   repo, which carries command-valued keys — trading a availability problem for
 *   an execution one. The correct mitigation is the one above: the ownership
 *   fatal is INDETERMINATE, and indeterminate now fails CLOSED to L1 instead of
 *   escalating to L5. Residual, stated plainly: on such a host the trust
 *   substrate pins to L1 with a loud reason naming the git error, and the
 *   operator clears it by owning the checkout, adding it to a repository-scoped
 *   config git will read, or setting CLAUDE_TRUST_STATE_DIR. That is an
 *   availability cost paid in the safe direction.
 *
 * Why common-dir is the primary (and the exclusion heuristic is NOT):
 *   `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` returns the SHARED git dir. A linked
 *   worktree (agent-isolation under .claude/worktrees/ OR a durable sibling
 *   like ~/repos/.loom-wt/<name>) has a `.git` FILE, and its common-dir
 *   resolves to the MAIN checkout's `.git` DIR. So the main top-level is the
 *   parent of the common git dir. This is an identity, not an ordering guess.
 *   The former "first worktree-list entry NOT under .claude/worktrees/" logic
 *   mis-selected a durable sibling worktree as "main" (a sibling is also NOT
 *   under .claude/worktrees/), shadowing the true main's coordination state.

// ── $CLAUDE_TRUST_STATE_DIR containment validation (#1444) ──────────────────
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. The override used to be honored UNCONDITIONALLY as a
// pure `dirname(dirname($CLAUDE_TRUST_STATE_DIR))` — no existence check, no
// containment test, no canonicalization, and no denylist entry. Because
// integrity-guard derives `repoDir = resolveMainCheckout(sessionCwd)` and then
// asks BOTH `isWatchedPath(target, repoDir)` and `isCoordinationEnabled(repoDir)`,
// pointing the variable at an EMPTY directory made the real posture.json /
// operators.roster.json fall outside `repoDir` (→ unwatched → passthrough) AND
// made the redirected root read as un-enrolled (→ coordination OFF → passthrough).
// Protected writes flipped from BLOCKED to ALLOWED with NO files planted.
//
// WHY VALIDATION AND NOT DENIAL. The override is a LEGITIMATE, in-use seam: the
// integration suite pins it at a fixture's own `<root>/.claude/learning`
// (c2-auth-hardening-iter2, protected-path-dimensions-1409-1429-1441,
// state-file-guard-case-parity). Denying it outright would break those and
// remove a documented affordance. What made it dangerous was not that it moves
// the root — it is that it moved the root ANYWHERE. So the fix constrains it to
// the ONE shape it is documented to express: the canonical trust-state directory
// of a REAL git checkout.
//
// THE PREDICATE, mirroring coordination-mode.js::_isCanonicalEcosystemConfig
// (rules/security.md § Path Containment — BOTH candidate and boundary root go
// through the SAME resolver before comparison, and the whole thing fails CLOSED):
//   1. absolute path, canonical shape `<root>/.claude/learning`;
//   2. `<root>` exists, is a directory, and git PROVES it is a checkout ROOT
//      (`provenCheckoutRoot`, loom#1474 E3 — see below). That proof is TWO
//      requirements, and naming only the first is what let loom#1586 through:
//      (2a) IDENTITY — git's `--show-toplevel` must BE `<root>`, not an
//           ancestor, which refuses a nested `<repo>/sub/.claude/learning`; and
//      (2b) COHERENCE — `<root>/.git` must NAME the repository git reported.
//           Load-bearing, not belt-and-braces: `core.worktree` is repo-LOCAL
//           config in an ANCESTOR's `.git/config` that `gitEnv()` cannot strip
//           (it removes SYSTEM/GLOBAL config and the whole `GIT_*` family, but
//           repo-local config is read BY DEFINITION once git discovers the
//           repo), and it makes git report a directory holding NO `.git` entry
//           at all as the toplevel. (2a) alone ACCEPTS that directory — i.e.
//           WEAKER on this axis than the `fs.existsSync(<root>/.git)` line it
//           replaced. Only (2b) refuses it;
//   3. the resolved `.claude` dir still sits at `<realRoot>/.claude` — so a
//      SYMLINKED `.claude` cannot relocate the canonical location itself;
//   4. when the learning dir already exists, its realpath must equal
//      `<realClaudeDir>/learning` — so a symlink planted at the canonical path
//      whose target escapes the checkout reads as RELOCATED and is refused.
//      When it does not exist yet, the verified parent chain is sufficient
//      (mkdir will create it INSIDE the already-canonicalized `.claude`), which
//      keeps first-use on a fresh checkout working.
// Any resolution error returns null → the caller IGNORES the override and falls
// through to the deterministic git-derived resolution, i.e. the protected
// behaviour, never an attacker-supplied path.

// coord-hook-budget, genesis-anchor-guard, pending-verification-grace,
// sessionend-release-lease, state-file-guard-case-parity,
// protected-path-dimensions-…) point it at an os.tmpdir() sandbox that is NOT a

// Applying the resolveMainCheckout predicate here REJECTS those sandboxes and
// falls back to git-derived resolution, which silently redirects their
// appendViolation writes into the REAL .claude/learning/violations.jsonl — the
// input to trust-posture.md MUST-4's cumulative downgrade math. That is strictly
// worse than the gap it closes: it corrupts the signal governing every operator's
// autonomy, and it does so SILENTLY because the suites still pass.
//
// The honest reason a predicate cannot serve both: "redirect the state root to an
// arbitrary directory" is the SAME operation whether a test or an attacker issues
// it. No property of the target distinguishes them — only a sanctioned
// test-context signal would, and that signal does not exist in this codebase yet
// (it is the same missing mechanism the COC_TEST_* seam family needs, loom#1450).
// Manufacturing a weak proxy here (e.g. "the directory exists") would be a fence
// an attacker steps over with one mkdir, which is worse than a named gap.

// RESIDUAL, stated plainly — and narrower than an earlier draft of this comment
// claimed. An attacker who can set $CLAUDE_TRUST_STATE_DIR redirects where state
// is WRITTEN, and the READ side is NOT closed against them either.
//
// What the read side actually rejects is a SYMLINKED ANCESTOR:
// `state-io.js::_assertStateDirContained` anchors on `dirname(dirname(dir))`,
// realpaths that, and re-joins the two known trailing components. That is
// SELF-RELATIVE — it proves the directory was not reached through a symlink. It
// does NOT tie the directory to this repository, and nothing downstream does
// either: an override is `determinate`, so it never trips the indeterminate
// refusal. A real, symlink-free `/tmp/attacker/.claude/learning` holding a
// planted posture.json therefore passes containment and IS read.
//
// So "fails closed on relocated state" means symlink-relocated ONLY. A reviewer
// reading the earlier wording would conclude reads were safe and only writes
// leaked; that was an over-claim, and this series' whole argument is that
// residuals get written down rather than argued away.
//
// The mitigations that DO hold are one layer up, not here: the settings-channel
// ADD is denylisted, and a HOST env export is outside the #1309 trust boundary
// by design. Closing this properly requires migrating the ~10 sandboxes onto a
// sanctioned isolation seam — the follow-on shard, NOT claimed closed here.
