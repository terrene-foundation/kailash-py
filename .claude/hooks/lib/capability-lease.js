/**
 * capability-lease — per-CAPABILITY single-writer lease for build→build
 * dependency-edge registration (the §4.3 R3-L1 cross-emitter serialization).
 *
 * ECO-IMPL Wave 4, Shard W4-S4 (A2-T3a). Companion to capability-dag.js (the
 * acyclicity-at-registration gate that holds this lease around its
 * read-DAG → decide-acyclic → emit-edge window). Implements
 * `workspaces/ecosystem-operating-model/02-plans/08-capability-lifecycle.md`
 * §4.3 ("Serialized registration via a per-CAPABILITY lease (R3-L1)").
 *
 * WHY a per-CAPABILITY lease and NOT the per-emitter hash-chain (§4.3 F7):
 * the per-emitter chain totally-orders ONE emitter's records, but two
 * DIFFERENT emitters declaring edges into the SAME capability are not
 * mutually serialized by it — the check-then-act window (read DAG → decide
 * acyclic → append edge) stays OPEN across emitters. The per-capability lease
 * serializes that window for cross-emitter contention WITHIN ONE CLONE: the
 * second edge-declaration to ACQUIRE the lease sees the first folded edge and
 * is rejected if it now closes a cycle.
 *
 * CROSS-CLONE SCOPE (load-bearing honesty, §4.3 / §1.1 detection-eventually
 * law): this on-disk mutex lives under THIS clone's `.claude/learning/` and
 * does NOT travel — two operators on DIFFERENT clones each hold their own
 * lease file, so the mutex provides ZERO cross-clone serialization. Two
 * clones can each pass their clone-LOCAL acyclicity check against a stale
 * fold and emit `A→B` + `B→A` that together close a cycle. That cross-clone
 * cycle is NOT prevented here; it is caught DETECTION-EVENTUALLY at fold time
 * by the AUTHORITATIVE acyclicity backstop in
 * `fold-capability-ledger.js::foldDependencyEdge` (deterministic fold-order
 * forward-reachability rejects whichever edge closes the cycle, consistently
 * on every clone — so the folded DAG stays acyclic everywhere). This lease is
 * the OPTIMISTIC clone-local fast-path (reject early, avoid lease churn + a
 * bad emit); the fold predicate is the authoritative defense. The full
 * cross-clone-PREVENTION (a closure-ordered multi-lease + a signed cross-clone
 * lease-visibility record like codify-lease.js's) is W5 A2-T3b.
 *
 * SHAPE REUSE (per framework-first.md §substrate-reuse): this is NOT a second
 * lease MECHANISM — it MIRRORS the proven `codify-lease.js` shape (the on-disk
 * atomic-write mutex; `_leasePath` derived from repoDir via resolveStateDir,
 * Sec-MED-3; the `_safeReadJson` corruption sentinel; the typed
 * conflict-result that surfaces the holder; the deterministic scope
 * fingerprint) keyed on the CAPABILITY whose dependency set is mutated, with
 * its own lease file so a capability-edge lease and a codify lease never
 * collide. codify-lease.js stays codify-class-coupled (mandatory codify scope
 * files, branch-forcing, codify-lease record emission); reusing it directly
 * would force codify state files into an edge-registration scope and emit the
 * wrong record type — so the reuse is at the SHAPE level, which §4.3 R3-L1
 * names ("the codify-lease shape … keyed on the capability"). The reuse is
 * the ON-DISK MUTEX half ONLY — it does NOT include codify-lease.js's signed
 * `codify-lease`/`-release` coordination-log record (that record is what gives
 * codify-lease its CROSS-CLONE visibility per knowledge-convergence.md MUST-3;
 * this edge-lease deliberately omits it — see CROSS-CLONE SCOPE above — because
 * a signed record would give cross-clone visibility but not cross-clone
 * PREVENTION, and the fold-time acyclicity backstop is the real defense).
 *
 * SCOPE BOUNDARY (load-bearing — NOT W4-S4; W5 A2-T3b):
 *   - This is the SINGLE per-capability lease ONLY. The graduation
 *     transitive-closure CLOSURE-ordered MULTI-lease (the deadlock-free,
 *     blocking-bounded-wait acquisition of EVERY capability in a transitive
 *     closure, with closure-stability re-derivation) is W5 A2-T3b — NOT here.
 *   - CRASH-ORPHAN: FIXED for BOTH leases now. The SINGLE-EDGE lease reclaims an
 *     aged-out record instead of wedging edge registration forever (§ liveness/
 *     TTL below); the MULTI-lease REAPS an aged-out O_EXCL lockfile instead of
 *     burning its full bounded wait and returning `deadline-exceeded` forever
 *     (§ multi-lease reaper below). The two reapers share ONE classifier but
 *     NOT one trigger shape: this lease releases by FLIPPING `_released`, the
 *     multi-lease releases by UNLINKING, so for the multi-lease the lockfile's
 *     EXISTENCE *is* the held state and there is no `_released` flag to consult.
 *     The IN-PROCESS exit paths (success / cycle-reject / conflict / error) ALL
 *     release via capability-dag.js's try/finally — only an out-of-process
 *     crash orphans either lease.
 *
 * Style: CommonJS, sync, pure node:fs / node:crypto, no external deps. Per
 * zero-tolerance.md Rule 3: every expected-failure path returns a typed
 * result; NEVER a throw on the conflict/dirty path, NEVER a silent fallback.
 *
 * Public API:
 *   acquireCapabilityLease({ capabilityId, holderId, repoDir? }) -> Result
 *     Result = { ok: true, lease: {...}, leasePath, capabilityId, reclaimed? }
 *           | { ok: false, reason, error, conflicting?: {...}, liveness? }
 *     reason ∈ { "conflict", "not-a-git-repo", "lease-corrupt",
 *                "invalid-capability-id", "invalid-holder-id" }
 *     `reclaimed` is present ONLY on a stale-lease takeover (§ liveness/TTL) and
 *     names the previous holder; `liveness` accompanies every `conflict` and
 *     explains WHY the lease is still held. Both are ADDITIVE — every
 *     pre-existing reason code and `conflicting` field is unchanged.
 *   releaseCapabilityLease({ capabilityId, holderId, repoDir? }) -> { ok, ... }
 *     reason ∈ { "no-lease", "already-released", "wrong-owner",
 *                "wrong-capability", "lease-corrupt", "not-a-git-repo",
 *                "invalid-capability-id", "invalid-holder-id" }
 *   readActiveCapabilityLease(capabilityId, repoDir?) -> { lease | null }
 *
 * The Result is the contract — callers (capability-dag.js) branch on `ok`,
 * surface the holder on conflict, and ALWAYS release on every exit path.

// LIVENESS / TTL — the crash-orphan reaper for the SINGLE-EDGE lease.
//
// THE DEFECT: acquire decided "another edge-registration holds the lease" on
// `existing && !existing._released` and nothing else. capability-dag.js releases
// on every in-process exit path via try/finally, so only an out-of-process crash
// orphans the lease — but when that happens the orphan is PERMANENT: every later
// edge registration in the repo returns `conflict` until a human deletes the
// file. A gate that cannot stop failing is worse than the race it prevents.
//
// THE SIGNAL — elapsed wall-clock since `acquired_at`, and nothing else.
//
// WHY NOT `pid`, even though it WOULD discriminate here. This is where this
// module's answer DIVERGES from codify-lease.js's, and the difference was
// MEASURED, not assumed. codify-lease's acquirer is a transient `node -e` helper
// that exits milliseconds after acquiring, so `process.kill(pid, 0)` returns
// ESRCH for a HEALTHY one-second-old lease exactly as it does for a crash
// orphan — the same output under both branches of the hypothesis, therefore not
// evidence (instrument-discipline.md MUST-1). Here the opposite holds: a healthy
// in-window lease probes ALIVE (measured: age=1081ms, pid alive) and a crash
// orphan probes DEAD(ESRCH), because registerDependencyEdge holds the lease
// only across one synchronous read-DAG → decide → emit window. pid IS
// discriminating for this module. It is still NOT the trigger, for two reasons:
//   (a) The PUBLIC API permits a CROSS-PROCESS hold. releaseCapabilityLease
//       matches on `holder_id` and never on pid, so a holder MAY legitimately
//       acquire in one process and release in another. capability-dag.js happens
//       to do both in one call frame; the contract does not require it, and a
//       pid reaper would steal that live lease.
//   (b) The record carries no process START-TOKEN. sessionend-release-lease.js
//       ::_classifyHolder pairs pid WITH a start-token precisely so a RECYCLED
//       pid is not misread as alive; without one, a pid-only reaper silently
//       fails to reap exactly when the pid recycled.
// A regression test locks that pid never becomes the reclaim trigger. If a
// future change adds a start-token AND narrows the API to same-process holds,
// pid+token becomes a strictly better PRIMARY signal with this TTL as backstop.
//
// THE FLOOR — 15 minutes. Sized for THIS lease's lifecycle, which is NOT
// codify-lease's session scope. A legitimate hold is one read-DAG →
// decide-acyclic → emit window: MEASURED at min 51ms / median 198ms / max 493ms
// across 25 registrations against a growing ledger. 15 minutes is ~1800x that
// worst case and 30x the module's own MULTILEASE_DEFAULT_DEADLINE_MS bounded
// wait, so it cannot plausibly steal a live lease; and it is short enough that a
// crashed registration self-heals within a break instead of wedging the repo for
// a working day. Copying codify-lease's 12h would have been wrong by ~50x — it
// is calibrated to a human session, and this lease has no human in it.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED ON AMBIGUITY: a MISSING, unparseable, non-string, or future-dated
// `acquired_at` all yield age = INDETERMINATE and the lease stays HELD. Only a
// positively-computed age at or past the floor reclaims, so this change can only
// ever refuse where the old code refused — except on the one proven-stale case.
// A corrupt lease file never reaches the classifier at all.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MULTI-LEASE (W5 A2-T3b) — the closure-ordered MULTI-lease over a SET of
// capabilities, held SIMULTANEOUSLY.
//
// The single-edge LEASE_FILE above is ONE repo-wide mutex keyed on the
// capability INSIDE the file (only one capability lease is active at a time) —
// the right shape for the single-edge case, WRONG for a graduation that must
// hold the WHOLE transitive closure's leases at once. The multi-lease therefore
// uses a SEPARATE per-capability lease file scheme: ONE file per leased
// capability, `capability-mlease-<sha256(capabilityId)>.json`, so N distinct
// capabilities can each hold their own file simultaneously (the simultaneity
// the single-file mutex cannot give).
//
// Deadlock-freedom is structural: every multi-acquirer takes the leases of the
// union it needs in the SAME canonical `capability_id`-sorted total order. With
// a single global acquisition order there is no hold-and-wait cycle (Coffman's
// fourth condition is broken), so two acquirers contending on an overlapping
// closure can never deadlock — the later one BLOCKS (bounded-wait) on the first
// contended lease in sorted order and proceeds once it frees.
//
// "Blocking bounded-wait" in a node hook lib with NO event loop = a bounded
// retry/poll loop with a DEADLINE + backoff against the on-disk file mutex. The
// DEADLINE makes the wait provably terminate (the livelock surface IS a DoS
// surface per security.md — an unbounded wait is the DoS). The canonical order
// guarantees no deadlock; the deadline guarantees no infinite wait. This is the
// simplest correct shape; the bound is DOCUMENTED on acquireMultiLease's opts.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MULTI-LEASE REAPER — the crash-orphan reaper for the O_EXCL lockfile.
//
// THE DEFECT, and why it was WORSE than the single-edge one. The lockfile's
// EXISTENCE is the lock and RELEASE is `unlink`, so there is no `_released`
// flag to consult — "is there a record?" IS "is it held?". Nothing reaped a
// lockfile whose holder died between acquireMultiLease and releaseMultiLease,
// so every later closure acquisition polled a lock that would never free for
// its FULL bounded-wait budget (30s by default) and then returned
// `deadline-exceeded`. Forever. The single-edge orphan at least failed FAST
// with `conflict`; this one charged 30 seconds per attempt to say the same
// thing. Fail-fast would have been more honest; a reaper is better than both.
//
// THE SIGNAL — elapsed wall-clock since `acquired_at`, exactly as the
// single-edge lease uses, through the SAME _classifyCapabilityLeaseLiveness
// classifier (one implementation, one place to change). The classifier reads
// only `acquired_at`, never `_released`, which is what lets it serve a
// flag-flip lease and an unlink lease unchanged.
//
// PLUS one signal the single-edge lease does not need: the filesystem MTIME,
// used ONLY when the lockfile's CONTENT is unreadable. An out-of-process crash
// BETWEEN openSync(...,"wx") and writeFileSync leaves a 0-BYTE lockfile that
// carries no `acquired_at` at all — the content signal is structurally absent,
// and without a fallback that exact orphan would stay permanent, i.e. the
// defect unfixed in its narrowest case. mtime is the only other timestamp the
// lockfile has; it is no weaker than `acquired_at` (both are wall-clock, both
// are forgeable by a local actor) and it is floored identically.
//
// WHY NOT `pid`, even though — unlike codify-lease — it DOES discriminate here.
// MEASURED for THIS lease, both arms, against the real multi-lease API:
//     ARM A (healthy lease, holder in-window): age=1038ms pid=80821 -> ALIVE
//     ARM B (crash orphan, holder exited):     age=20ms   pid=82659 -> DEAD(ESRCH)
// The falsifying result was nameable and was the thing being looked for: had
// ARM A printed DEAD(ESRCH), pid would be non-discriminating here exactly as it
// is for codify-lease's transient `node -e` acquirer, and that conclusion would
// transfer. It printed ALIVE. pid IS a discriminating signal for this lease. It
// is STILL not the trigger, for the same two reasons the single-edge lease
// records, both of which hold verbatim here:
//   (a) `_releaseOneMultiLease` matches on `holder_id` and NEVER on pid, so the
//       public contract permits a cross-process hold; a pid reaper would steal
//       that live lock.
//   (b) the lockfile carries no process START-TOKEN, so a RECYCLED pid reads as
//       alive and the reaper would silently fail to reap exactly when it
//       matters. (sessionend-release-lease.js::_classifyHolder pairs pid WITH a
//       token precisely for this.)
// Note pid could not even be used as a NARROWING conjunct ("stale AND pid
// dead"): that makes the reaper strictly LESS able to un-wedge — the recycled
// pid case is exactly where it would refuse — which is the wrong direction for
// a fix whose entire purpose is un-wedging.
//
// THE FLOOR — 15 minutes base, WIDENED to 2x the caller's declared wait budget
// when that budget is larger. The base matches the single-edge lease because
// the graduation body it protects is the same class of window (a bounded
// read-closure -> decide-acyclic -> emit). The scaling term is what the
// single-edge lease does NOT need: the FIRST lease in canonical order is held
// for the entire acquisition of the REST of the closure — up to deadlineMs —
// BEFORE the caller's body even starts. With the 30s default, 2x30s = 60s is
// far under the 15-min base and the term is inert; it only bites when a caller
// declares a wait budget over 7.5 min, which is precisely the case where a flat
// 15-min floor would be too tight and would reap a legitimately in-progress
// acquisition. What it CANNOT do: it scales on THIS acquirer's deadline, not on
// the (unrecorded) deadline the HOLDER used.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED ON AMBIGUITY, on every path: missing / unparseable / non-string /
// future-dated `acquired_at`, an unreadable lockfile whose mtime cannot be
// stat'ed, a lockfile that CHANGED or VANISHED between classify and unlink —
// all leave the lock HELD. Only a positively-computed age at or past the floor
// reaps, so this change can only ever refuse where the old code refused, except
// on the one positively-proven-stale case.

// the floor makes every FRESH lockfile look stale) degrades into ordinary
// bounded contention instead of a no-sleep spin. The livelock surface is a DoS
// surface (security.md).
//
// This constant is the SOLE termination bound on the reap path: the deadline
// deliberately does NOT gate a post-reap retry (see acquireMultiLease's `reaped`

 * Unlink a lockfile that was classified STALE — the reap.

 * unless it is byte-for-byte the same lock that was classified (`lease_id` +
 * `acquired_at` + `holder_id` for a readable lockfile; mtime + size for an
 * unreadable one). Without the guard, the window between classify and unlink is
 * the whole poll interval, and a holder that released in that window followed by
 * a DIFFERENT acquirer creating a FRESH lock would have its fresh lock deleted —
 * a mutual-exclusion break introduced by the fix itself.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, stated rather than implied: it NARROWS that window to
 * the microseconds between the confirming read and the unlink; it does not CLOSE
 * it. POSIX `unlink` takes a path, not an inode or an fd, so there is no
 * unlink-if-unchanged primitive to call — closing it entirely needs an fd-based
 * protocol this lockfile shape does not have. The residual: a fresh lock created
 * inside that microsecond window would be unlinked. Bounded, and the same class
 * the single-edge lease's TTL takeover already accepts.
 *
 * On success the caller does NOT get the lock — it falls through to the ordinary
 * O_EXCL create, so the atomic test-and-set stays the ONE acquisition primitive.
 * If a third party wins that create, the loser simply contends as normal.

 *                              It bounds WAITING only — it never aborts a retry
 *                              that follows a completed reap, because a reap is
 *                              progress rather than waiting and the lock is
 *                              already free by then (that path terminates on
 *                              MULTILEASE_MAX_REAPS_PER_LEASE instead).

 *   - _now          {function?} injectable clock (Date.now) for deterministic
 *                              deadline tests.
 *   - _sleep        {function?} injectable busy-wait (default: a bounded spin)
 *                              so tests need not actually sleep.
