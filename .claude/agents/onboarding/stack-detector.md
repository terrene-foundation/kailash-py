# Stack Detector Agent

Reads project manifest files at the project root (and one level deep, for monorepo single-package layouts) and reports the detected language + framework + tooling with an explicit confidence grade. Used by the `/onboard-stack` command before any auto-scaffolding decision.

## When to Use

- New repo adopts the base variant — first invocation of `/onboard-stack`
- Repo's host stack changed (language migration, monorepo split, primary-language shift)
- Stack-aware specialist (`db-specialist`, `api-specialist`, `ai-specialist`) reports HALT-confidence and asks for re-detection

**Do NOT use** when the user has already authored `STACK.md` with declared HIGH confidence. Re-detection MUST be human-requested per `rules/stack-detection.md`.

## Detection Inputs

The detector reads (in this priority order):

| Manifest             | Maps to       | Notes                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pyproject.toml`     | Python        | Read `[project].name`, `[project.optional-dependencies]`, `[tool.poetry]`, `[tool.hatch]` |
| `package.json`       | JavaScript/TS | Inspect `engines`, `devDependencies` for `typescript`, `vitest`/`jest`, `tsc`/`swc`       |
| `Cargo.toml`         | Rust          | `[package]`, `[workspace]`, edition; treat workspaces as multi-crate                      |
| `go.mod`             | Go            | Module path + Go version; check for `go.work` (workspaces)                                |
| `Gemfile`            | Ruby          | Bundler manifest; check Ruby version + `gemspec` adjacent                                 |
| `pom.xml`            | Java          | Maven; read `<groupId>`, `<artifactId>`, `<dependencies>`                                 |
| `build.gradle.kts`   | Kotlin / Java | Gradle Kotlin DSL; also `build.gradle` (Groovy DSL)                                       |
| `mix.exs`            | Elixir        | Mix project + version + deps                                                              |
| `Package.swift`      | Swift         | SwiftPM manifest; `targets:`, `dependencies:`                                             |
| `composer.json`      | PHP           | `require`, `require-dev`, framework hints (Laravel / Symfony)                             |
| `*.csproj` / `*.sln` | C# / .NET     | Look for `<TargetFramework>`, package references                                          |
| `.tool-versions`     | (multi-stack) | asdf-style; treat as confirmation, not primary detection                                  |

The detector MUST scan the project root first; if zero manifests are found there, scan one level deep (typical monorepo `apps/*/`, `packages/*/`, `crates/*/`).

## Confidence Grading (REQUIRED)

The detector emits exactly one of four confidence grades per detected stack. The grade is a function of evidence strength, not the agent's certainty.

| Grade   | Evidence                                                                                                   | /onboard-stack behavior         |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| HIGH    | Single primary manifest at root + lockfile present + version pin + matching framework signal               | May proceed with confirmation   |
| MEDIUM  | Primary manifest present BUT lockfile absent OR ambiguous framework signal OR multiple competing manifests | MUST request human confirmation |
| LOW     | Manifest fragments only (e.g. lockfile without primary manifest) OR conflicting hints across files         | MUST request human confirmation |
| UNKNOWN | No recognized manifest at root or one level deep                                                           | MUST halt; emit empty STACK.md  |

**MUST NOT auto-scaffold from MEDIUM, LOW, or UNKNOWN.** Per `rules/verify-resource-existence.md`, low-confidence detections require human gate before any state-changing follow-up.

## Output Format

Emits a structured report (markdown), NOT a `STACK.md` write. The `/onboard-stack` command writes `STACK.md` after human confirmation.

```markdown
# Stack Detection Report

- **Confidence**: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | UNKNOWN
- **Language**: python | typescript | go | rust | ruby | java | kotlin | elixir | swift | php | csharp | unknown
- **Version**: <pinned version, or "unspecified">
- **Package Manager**: pip | uv | poetry | hatch | npm | pnpm | yarn | cargo | go | bundler | mvn | gradle | mix | swift | composer | dotnet
- **Test Runner**: pytest | unittest | vitest | jest | mocha | go-test | nextest | rspec | junit | kotest | exunit | xctest | phpunit | xunit
- **Build Tool**: <build/check command>
- **Framework signals**: [list of detected frameworks, empty if none]
- **Evidence**:
  - <file>: <line / fragment>
  - <file>: <line / fragment>
- **Caveats**: <ambiguity notes, conflicting hints, monorepo notes>
```

## MUST NOT

- Auto-write `STACK.md` (the command does that after human confirmation)
- Skip the confidence grade (every report has exactly one)
- Score HIGH on conflicting evidence (e.g. both `package.json` AND `Cargo.toml` at root → at least MEDIUM, likely LOW)
- Score HIGH on missing lockfile (lockfile is part of the HIGH-confidence contract)

**Why:** Auto-scaffolding from low-confidence detection is the exact failure mode `rules/verify-resource-existence.md` blocks at API-call sites — applied here to stack-onboarding sites.

## Related Agents

- **idiom-advisor** — once stack is HIGH-confidence, idiom-advisor produces per-stack idioms for use in subsequent shards
- **db-specialist / api-specialist / ai-specialist** — read `STACK.md` (post-detection); halt if missing

## Origin

2026-05-06 v2.21.0 base-variant Phase 1. Pairs with `/onboard-stack` command and `rules/stack-detection.md`.
