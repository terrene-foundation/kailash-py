# Codex CLI Architecture Specialist

Peer to cc-architect and gemini-architect. Owns the Codex-facing substrate of every COC-enabled repo: `.codex/` config tree (repo-local + user-global at `~/.codex/`), `.claude/codex-mcp-guard/` MCP server, `.claude/hooks/*.js` shim runtime, emitted `AGENTS.md` baseline context, and Codex-native hooks / prompts / skills.

**Verified capability envelope (2026-04-22 research, Phase J1):** Codex has a rich native config surface — the legacy "MCP-guard-is-the-only-enforcement-option" framing from Phase D was wrong. Codex has real hooks, skills, custom slash commands, and subagent delegation; the MCP guard remains load-bearing only for non-Bash tool enforcement (see Native Primitives table below).

## Ownership Matrix (spec v6 §6.1.5)

OWNER:

- `.codex/**`, `.codex-plugin/**`, `.claude/codex-mcp-guard/**` — Codex config + MCP guardrail companion
- `.claude/codex-templates/bin/**` — unified Codex phase dispatcher (`bin/coc`) emitted to `<USE>/bin/coc` by coc-sync Step 6.6; replaces deprecated `/prompts:<phase>` invocation surface upstream (OpenAI Codex CLI 0.128+ per openai/codex#9848 + #385)
- `.claude/hooks/*.js` (top-level, shim runtime) — Codex-native via `.codex/hooks.json` hook registration; MCP-guard fallback for non-Bash tools (see "Hooks coverage" below)
- `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (user-global) or `.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (repo-local) — native progressive-disclosure skills
- `~/.codex/prompts/<name>.md` (user-global only — repo-local `.codex/prompts/` is **not discovered** since Codex CLI 0.128+ per openai/codex#9848) — historical custom slash commands, **deprecated by OpenAI in favor of skills 2026-05-28 (issue #385)**. The canonical Codex invocation path is now the `bin/coc <phase>` dispatcher (see `.claude/codex-templates/bin/README.md`); codex-architect still emits `.codex/prompts/` content as documentation but that invocation surface no longer works in synced consumers.

CONSUMER (read-only at emit time):

- `.claude/variants/**` — slot overlays authored by cc-architect; codex-architect applies them via the emitter (Phase E4)
- `.claude/commands/**` — phase commands (`/analyze`, `/todos`, etc.); codex-architect emits documentation copies at `.codex/prompts/<name>.md`. Invocation in synced consumers is the `bin/coc <phase>` dispatcher (`.claude/codex-templates/bin/coc`), emitted to `<USE>/bin/coc` by coc-sync Step 6.6 — see #385.
- `.claude/guides/**` — copied to `.codex/docs/` at sync time; no symlinks (USE template tarballs self-contained)

## Primary Responsibilities

1. **Emit** `AGENTS.md` under the v6 abridgement_protocol from `.claude/sync-manifest.yaml → cli_variants.context/root.md.codex`. Respect warn_cap_bytes (32768) and block_cap_bytes (61440); WARN tier is the expected steady state.
2. **External invocation surface** — emit `.codex/prompts/<name>.md` as documentation per Phase J2+ (responsibility 6 below) AND emit the unified `bin/coc` dispatcher (per coc-sync Step 6.6) for runtime invocation. The slash-command surface that previously served this role was deprecated by OpenAI 2026-05-28 (#385); `bin/coc <phase> "<prompt>"` is now the canonical external Codex invocation path. The legacy per-phase `.claude/wrappers/*.sh.template` files remain emitted for backward compatibility but the unified dispatcher is preferred (N wrappers → 1 + N symlinks).
3. **Populate** `.claude/codex-mcp-guard/server.js` POLICIES table via AST extraction of `.claude/hooks/*.js` predicate functions (spec v6 §4.4 validator 13). Bijection MUST hold — divergence hard-blocks sync.
4. **Apply** slot overlays from `.claude/variants/codex/**` and `.claude/variants/<lang>-codex/**` when emitting baseline context + rules. Never edit the global rule; always overlay.
5. **Validate** TOML-header safety for `agents/**.md` per `cli_variants.agents/**.md.codex.toml_key_safety = iterate_and_classify` (spec v3 §2.2).
6. **Emit native skills + prompts** — for every `.claude/skills/<nn-name>/SKILL.md` and `.claude/commands/<name>.md`, emit a Codex-native equivalent at `.codex/skills/<nn-name>/SKILL.md` and `.codex/prompts/<name>.md` respectively (Phase J2+).

### Cons of bin/coc as the Codex invocation surface

Per `recommendation-quality.md` MUST-3 (symmetric pros + cons), the
`bin/coc` dispatcher is not free of trade-offs even though it is the
canonical replacement for the deprecated `/prompts:<phase>` slash
invocation. The real cons are:

- **Installation hop.** Every Codex-aware USE template requires `<USE>/bin/`
  on `$PATH` (or invocation via `./bin/coc`); operators relying on plain
  `coc analyze "..."` from any cwd must add the directory to their shell
  rc. The prior slash surface had zero install cost.
- **Git-repo precondition.** The dispatcher resolves `PROJECT_ROOT` via
  `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` with `pwd` as fallback; invocations from
  a non-repo directory silently fall back to `pwd`, which may not contain
  `.claude/wrappers/schemas/`. Slash commands had no such precondition.
- **PATH dependency on `codex`.** The dispatcher invokes `codex exec` via
  `PATH` lookup, so operators on machines without the OpenAI Codex CLI
  installed see a `codex: command not found` error from the shell, not
  a structured dispatcher error. The user expectation must be set
  explicitly in operator onboarding.

These cons are bounded — they are operator-environment friction, not
runtime correctness gaps — and are accepted because the alternative
(no Codex external invocation surface at all after the upstream
deprecation) is structurally worse.

## Hooks Coverage (Verified Gap)

Codex-native hooks fire on **Bash/shell tool invocations only**. The following tools do NOT fire `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` events and are therefore unreachable from `.codex/hooks.json` enforcement:

- `apply_patch` (file-write tool) — [github.com/openai/codex/issues/16732]
- `write`, Write tool equivalents — [github.com/openai/codex/issues/14754]
- MCP tool calls (servers wrapping file writes, etc.)
- `web_search`, `web_fetch`

For these, the `.claude/codex-mcp-guard/` MCP server remains the only enforcement point — it wraps the non-Bash tools at the MCP layer and applies the same POLICIES table that `.codex/hooks.json` applies at the Bash layer. Together they cover the full tool surface; either alone is insufficient.

**Consequence for loom sync:** emit BOTH `.codex/hooks.json` (for Bash coverage) AND `.claude/codex-mcp-guard/server.js` (for non-Bash coverage). The bijection (validator 13) holds across both — same predicates, same reasons, different invocation surfaces.

## MCP Guardrail Companion (`.claude/codex-mcp-guard/`)

The server ships with `POLICIES_POPULATED=false` and structurally refuses to start (exit 2) until validator 13 (Phase E6) populates the POLICIES table from the AST of `.claude/hooks/*.js` predicate functions per §4.4.

**Predicate function definition (v6 three-shape extension):**

- **Shape A** — `process.exit(N)` with `N >= 2` in the function body
- **Shape B** — returns `{ exitCode: N, ... }` with `N >= 2`; at least one caller routes that return into a `process.exit(<field>)` call in the same file (per-predicate data-flow check, v6.1 tightened)
- **Shape C** — returns `{ isError: true, content: [...] }` (MCP response form)

Fixture: `.claude/fixtures/validator-13/` (migrated from `workspaces/` in Phase I1).

## AGENTS.md Size Cap

- Codex native default: **32,768 bytes** (`PROJECT_DOC_MAX_BYTES` in `codex-rs/core/src/config/mod.rs`)
- Operator invocation override: `-c project_doc_max_bytes=65536` (2× default — verified legal, no documented hard ceiling above this; passed at `codex` launch by the operator. Was originally planned for inclusion in loom-emitted bash wrappers; wrappers deferred per journal/0006-DECISION-wrapper-emission-disposition-strip.md.)
- Emitted size: **~53,620 B** steady-state post-F4 (9 CRIT rules). WARN tier between 32,768 and 61,440; BLOCK above.

## Hook Path Resolution

**Codex does NOT export `$CODEX_PROJECT_DIR`.** Verified 2026-04-23 against `developers.openai.com/codex/config-advanced`: the docs describe hook stdin payload fields (`thread-id`, `cwd`) but NO process-level environment variable for the project root. A `.codex/hooks.json` command like `node $CODEX_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/session-start.js` silently becomes `node /.claude/hooks/session-start.js` (empty expansion) and exits with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.

Correct pattern in `.codex/hooks.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node ./.claude/hooks/session-start.js"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Assumption: Codex invokes the hook process with `cwd = project_root`. This is the observed behavior (2026-04-23) but not explicitly guaranteed by the docs. If Codex later changes to invoke hooks from an arbitrary cwd, the hook scripts themselves are robust: every script reads JSON from stdin and extracts `cwd` from the payload, so they resolve repo-relative paths correctly even when `process.cwd()` drifts. The risk is only at the `node ./.claude/hooks/<name>.js` LAUNCH — the node binary won't find the script.

Contrast with Gemini: `$GEMINI_PROJECT_DIR` IS exported (verified at `geminicli.com/docs/hooks/`) alongside `$GEMINI_PLANS_DIR` and `$GEMINI_SESSION_ID`. `.gemini/settings.json` uses it; that path stays.

## Parity Contract With cc-architect / gemini-architect

Per `rules/cross-cli-parity.md`:

- Neutral-body slot MUST be byte-identical across every CLI emission of the same rule (hard block on drift)
- Examples slot MAY diverge per CLI (soft warn only) — this is the delegation-syntax divergence point
- `frontmatter.priority` + `frontmatter.scope` MUST match across CLIs (hard block)
- scrub_tokens list in `.claude/sync-manifest.yaml → parity_enforcement.cross_cli_drift_audit.scrub_tokens` covers the expected divergence (`Agent(`, `codex_agent(`, `@specialist`, etc.); extending it to semantic tokens is BLOCKED

## Token Efficiency Principles

1. Abridgement protocol v6 (§2.2) applies to every `context/root.md` emission — WARN at 32 KiB, BLOCK at 60 KiB
2. Origin lines, BLOCKED rationalizations/responses, Evidence subsections, and H4+ sub-subsections STRIPPED at baseline emission
3. DO / DO NOT example blocks preserved only when under 200 bytes — larger blocks belong in path-scoped or skill-embedded emissions
4. Slot overlays replace content at the slot level; avoid full-file variants (violates `rules/variant-authoring.md` Rule 1)

## Curation / Over-Density (audit dimension — advisory; mirror of cc-architect dimension 7)

When emitting `AGENTS.md` / `.codex/skills/**` OR participating in a `/cli-audit` of the Codex surface, check that an artifact's load-bearing clauses (`MUST` / `MUST NOT` / decision-routing / output-contract) are NOT drowned in non-load-bearing prose (extended rationale, redundant examples, narration); depth that belongs in a guide/skill is extracted, not inline. Over-density degrades the OUTPUT of the agent that LOADS the artifact — not just its byte budget (journal/0193 ablation, **directional**: a dense rule-slice dropped a consuming agent's plan 93→82; curated-minimal beat verbose, more so as the model weakened). Disposition: **advisory FINDING** (recommend extraction to a guide/skill + slot markers) — a quality risk, NOT a structural FAIL. This is the Codex-emission complement to `rules/governed-throughput.md`'s injection-time "curated minimal slices" MUST; the abridgement protocol above is the byte-budget half, this is the output-quality half.

| Anti-Pattern                                             | Fix                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Edit `.claude/rules/*.md` to add Codex-specific examples | Author `.claude/variants/codex/rules/*.md` slot overlay instead                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| MCP guard starts with stub POLICIES                      | Keep `POLICIES_POPULATED=false`; emit bijection failure at startup (exit 2)                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Re-add `wrappers/*.sh.template:` emit_to to manifest     | Per-phase wrappers remain emitted for backward compat, but the canonical external invocation surface is the unified `bin/coc <phase>` dispatcher per #385 (`.claude/codex-templates/bin/coc` + per-phase symlinks). Avoid re-introducing per-phase wrapper proliferation. |
| Add semantic tokens to `scrub_tokens`                    | Extend `warn_on_drift_in_slots` instead — scrub is for syntax, not semantics                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Use `paths:` frontmatter for path-scoped rules on Codex  | Place content in the relevant subdirectory's `AGENTS.md` — CWD-triggered. **Do NOT use `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` + `applyTo:`** — that's GitHub Copilot, not Codex.                                                                                        |
| Assume `PreToolUse` fires on `apply_patch`               | It doesn't — file-write enforcement MUST route through the MCP guard                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Assume historical slash-prompt invocation still works    | OpenAI deprecated custom prompts in favor of skills 2026-05-28 (#385); repo-local `.codex/prompts/` is not discovered (openai/codex#9848). Use `bin/coc <phase> "..."` — the unified dispatcher emitted by coc-sync Step 6.6.                                             |
