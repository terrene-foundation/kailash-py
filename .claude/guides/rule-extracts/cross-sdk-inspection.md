# Cross-SDK Issue Inspection — Extended Examples

Companion reference for `.claude/rules/cross-sdk-inspection.md`. Holds the full
code examples the rule body abridges to a compact DO/DO-NOT + pointer, so the
path-scoped rule stays under the per-profile rule-injection budget (`loom#678`).

## Rule 3a — Structural API-Divergence Disposition (full test pair)

When the sibling SDK reports a bug at an API surface this SDK does NOT expose,
the disposition MUST include BOTH a sibling-path Tier 2 test (the bug class may
manifest at a different parameter-binding surface here) AND a signature-invariant
test (so a future arity-growth refactor toward the sibling shape fails loudly).

```python
# DO — both tests; one exercises the sibling path, one locks the signature
@pytest.mark.regression
async def test_issue_XXX_cross_sdk_parity_via_sibling_path(test_suite):
    # The Rust bug triggered at execute_raw(sql, params). Python execute_raw
    # has no params. The parameter-binding path in Python is Express.bulk_create.
    db = DataFlow(test_suite.config.url)
    # ... exercise shrinking-arity bulk_create against real Postgres
    assert poisoned_result.get("success") is True

@pytest.mark.regression
def test_issue_XXX_execute_raw_has_no_params_arg():
    # Structural invariant: if this signature ever grows a `params` kwarg,
    # the sibling bug class becomes reachable here and cross-SDK parity
    # MUST be re-audited.
    import inspect
    from dataflow.core.pool_lightweight import LightweightPool
    sig = inspect.signature(LightweightPool.execute_raw)
    non_self = [p.name for n, p in sig.parameters.items() if n != "self"]
    assert non_self == ["sql"], f"signature drifted: {sig}"

# DO NOT — close the cross-SDK issue with only a hand-waving comment
gh issue close XXX --comment "N/A — Python execute_raw has no params arg"
# ↑ no test, no invariant; a future refactor silently reopens the bug class
#   and the original sibling-report loses its correlation
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "The signatures are obviously different, no test needed"
- "Our implementation can't have that bug"
- "The structural invariant is enforced by the type system"
- "Cross-SDK is belt-and-suspenders; one test is enough"
- "We'll add the invariant test when the signature changes"

Evidence: issue #525 (cross-SDK of the Rust SDK's #424) — Python `execute_raw(sql)`
structurally cannot hit the Rust binding-layer UTF-8 corruption; disposition landed
both an Express `bulk_create` sibling-path test AND a signature invariant test
locking `LightweightPool.execute_raw(sql)` at PR #528.

## Rule 4 — Byte-Vector Pinning (full example)

Any helper claiming byte-shape parity with a sibling SDK MUST pin ≥3 byte-vector
cases empirically derived from the sibling SDK's actual output, covering sentinels
(empty input, all-zero, single-byte), as raw hex strings in a regression test — NOT
abstract "same length" / "starts with sha256:" assertions.

```python
# DO — pin actual byte vectors from sibling SDK
@pytest.mark.regression
def test_fingerprint_secret_matches_kailash_rs_byte_for_byte():
    # Vectors derived from the Rust SDK Blake2bVar(4) digest output at v3.23.0
    cases = [
        (b"",                             "00000000"),  # empty-input sentinel
        (b"hello",                        "8ed5b1d4"),
        (b"\x00" * 32,                    "0a0e0a8b"),
        (b"OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-12345",      "f3c2b1d8"),
    ]
    for raw, expected in cases:
        assert fingerprint_secret(raw) == expected, f"divergence on {raw!r}"

# DO NOT — abstract parity claim with no byte pinning
def test_fingerprint_secret_has_4_hex_chars():
    out = fingerprint_secret(b"hello")
    assert len(out) == 4 and all(c in "0123456789abcdef" for c in out)
    # ↑ proves shape but NOT byte-for-byte equivalence to the sibling SDK
```

The empty-input sentinel is the canonical divergence point: a digest mode emits a
stable hash; a MAC mode emits a length-prefixed empty MAC (`Blake2bMac<U4>` vs
`Blake2bVar(4)` — lengths agree, bytes don't). Evidence: the Rust SDK PR #598 first
cut shipped MAC mode while kailash-py uses digest mode; caught by 2 reviewers only
because abstract parity assertions were absent.

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "Both SDKs use SHA-256; the implementations must agree"
- "Length + hex-char regex is sufficient"
- "We'll align the byte shapes when a divergence is reported"
- "The sibling SDK's vectors will drift; pinning them creates maintenance"
- "Cross-SDK log correlation is a nice-to-have, not a contract"

Origin: the Rust SDK PR #598 (2026-04-25) cross-SDK fingerprint helper — first cut had empty-input + algorithm-mode divergence with kailash-py; caught by reviewers but only because abstract parity assertions were absent. Codified to make the absence loud.

## Rule 3a — Origin

Origin: Issue #525 / PR #528 (2026-04-19) — the Rust SDK's #424 parity check.

## Rule 4a — Sibling-Canonical Fixtures (full example)

```
# DO — vendor the canonical file from the sibling repo
$ cp ../kailash-py/tests/fixtures/trace-event-canonical.json \
     bindings/<rust-sdk-repo>/test-vectors/trace-event-canonical.json
$ git add bindings/<rust-sdk-repo>/test-vectors/trace-event-canonical.json
# Update Rust loader + Python binding test + pin-gen script to read canonical shape — same PR.

# DO NOT — maintain a parallel hand-authored copy
# rs-side fixture: { "id": "v1", "input": "..." }   ← drifted shape
# py-side fixture: { "name": "v1", "input_repr": "..." }   ← canonical shape
# fingerprints happen to match for V4-V5 but not V1-V3; cross-SDK contract silently broken.
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "Re-authoring is faster than vendoring; the JSON is short"
- "We'll vendor when the sibling SDK formalizes the canonical"
- "Field-name divergence is cosmetic, fingerprints still match"
- "Vendoring creates a sync burden every time the sibling updates the fixture"
- "Our loader can normalize either shape; vendoring isn't strictly required"

Parallel copies drift in shape (`id`/`input` vs `name`/`input_repr`) AND content (different cosmetic input data); vendoring guarantees byte-for-byte file-level parity. Orphaned consumers reading the old shape fail at first CI run with KeyError / `cannot find field` / "missing field `id`". The "sync burden" argument inverts the actual cost: parallel copies create N × M sync work on every fixture edit; vendoring creates 1 sync work per edit (a file copy from sibling repo).

Origin: the Rust SDK PR #761 (merged 8286775f, 2026-05-02) — vendored `test-vectors/trace-event-canonical.json` from `terrene-foundation/kailash-py:main`. Pre-vendor: rs-side fixture had `id`/`input` shape with V1-V3 inputs cosmetically different from py-side; V4-V5 fingerprints already matched, V1-V3 weren't. Post-vendor: all 5 V1-V5 fingerprints reproduce byte-for-byte through both Rust `compute_trace_event_fingerprint` AND Python binding `serialize_canonical_json`. Same-shard sibling consumer fix per `autonomous-execution.md` Rule 4 (Python binding test orphaned at first push, CI surfaced it, fix-immediately landed in same PR commit `10274a5d`). Codified GLOBAL via /sync rs Gate 1 (2026-05-02 second cycle).

## Rule 4b — Byte-CHANGING Canonical-Encoder Switches (full example)

```python
# DO — empirically classify, then pin current bytes for the byte-CHANGING site (py-illustrative)
@pytest.mark.regression
def test_witness_sign_payload_pins_current_default_str_bytes():
    # CROSS_SDK_BLOCKED: AuditAnchor reaches the encoder un-normalized; default=str
    # stringifies the dataclass repr, canonical_scalars asdict-expands it → different SHA.
    # the sibling SDK mirrors these CURRENT bytes; a single-SDK switch diverges the two SDKs.
    assert _sign_payload(fixture) == "edfdf52b…"   # tripwire until the sibling-SDK lockstep
# (the byte-NEUTRAL sibling — envelope_hash, where normalization pre-normalizes — SHIPPED single-SDK)

# DO NOT — switch a byte-CHANGING signing encoder single-SDK (py-illustrative)
def to_canonical_json(self):
    return json.dumps(self._hashable_dict(), default=canonical_scalars)  # was default=str
    # ↑ silently diverges every on-disk signed artifact from the sibling SDK's bytes;
    #   no test pins the old bytes, so the cross-SDK break is invisible until a verify fails.
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "canonical_scalars is stricter / more correct, so switching is an improvement"
- "I reasoned through the types; it can't change the bytes" (reason is not a byte-diff)
- "The sibling SDK will catch up on its next release"
- "It's one encoder; the lockstep ceremony is overkill"
- "Pinning the OLD bytes blocks the migration I'm trying to do"

Empirical byte-diff (run the code, compare SHAs) is the only sound classifier — "I reasoned the types are equivalent" is exactly how the audit-chain / witness-family / envelope-HMAC sites were each almost switched single-SDK. Pinning the current bytes converts the deferred lockstep from an un-tracked memory into a test that fails loudly the moment someone switches one side.

## Rule 4c — Conformance-Vector Integrity-Manifest Re-Pin (full example)

```bash
# DO — re-pin the manifest in the same commit that changes the vector
$ edit tests/trust/pact/conformance/vectors/audit_anchor.json   # the canonical fix
$ shasum -a256 tests/trust/.../audit_anchor.json                 # recompute
$ edit PACT_VECTORS.sha256                                       # re-pin in SAME commit
$ shasum -a256 -c PACT_VECTORS.sha256                            # verify green before push

# DO NOT — change the vector, leave the manifest stale
$ edit tests/trust/.../audit_anchor.json && git commit           # manifest unchanged
# ↑ remote `Verify vector integrity` (shasum -c) goes RED ("audit_anchor.json: FAILED");
#   a "converged" redteam that never ran shasum -c declares clean over a red CI gate.
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "The vector change is correct; the manifest is a separate concern"
- "CI will catch the manifest if it's stale" (catching it red ≠ shipping it green)
- "The redteam already converged" (a convergence claim over a red remote gate is false — `verify-resource-existence.md` MUST-4)
- "shasum -c isn't part of the canonical-conformance lens-set"

Evidence: PR #1411 (2026-06-20) shipped the correct `audit_anchor.json` canonical fix but omitted the `PACT_VECTORS.sha256` re-pin → red `Cross-SDK Conformance` gate that a prior "converged (2 clean passes)" redteam missed because no round ran `shasum -c`.

## Rule 4d — Prune-When-Unset From The Signing Pre-Image (full example)

```python
# DO — a shared signing-pre-image builder prunes the UNSET new field
_NEW_OPTIONAL_FIELDS = ("circuit_failure_threshold", "circuit_window_seconds", "circuit_cooldown_seconds")
def _signing_dict(model) -> dict:
    payload = model.model_dump(mode="json")
    nested = payload.get("operational")
    if isinstance(nested, dict):
        for f in _NEW_OPTIONAL_FIELDS:
            if nested.get(f) is None:
                nested.pop(f, None)          # unset → zero bytes → byte-identical to pre-addition
    return payload
# both sign AND verify call _signing_dict(...) (a mismatch breaks within-version signatures)

# DO NOT — add the field, sign the raw model_dump (null key changes EVERY signature)
payload = serialize_for_signing(model.model_dump(mode="json"))   # emits "circuit_*":null for a breaker-less
# → every pre-existing / cross-SDK-signed instance now fails verify(); a backward-compat + cross-SDK break
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "The field is optional, adding it is backward-compatible"
- "`exclude_none=True` on the dump fixes it" (it drops OTHER pre-existing nulls too — a wider break)
- "I reasoned the bytes; a not-set field can't matter" (reason is not a byte-diff)
- "The within-version sign/verify round-trip passes" (it can't catch cross-VERSION — both halves use the new code)
- "It's a new SDK version; existing signatures re-issuing is fine"

Prune-when-unset makes the addition byte-neutral for the not-configured case (the BH3 unbound/bound pattern applied to field additions), confining the lockstep to instances that actually opt into the new field.

Evidence: kailash-py #1510 BH5 (PR #1671 → release #1672, kailash 2.48.0, 2026-07-11) — adding `circuit_*` fields to `OperationalConstraintConfig` (nested in the signed `ConstraintEnvelopeConfig`) changed the Ed25519 pre-image for every envelope; a two-round `/redteam` caught the HIGH, fixed via `_envelope_signing_dict` prune-when-unset.

## Rule 4e — Serializer-Set Completeness For A Signed Model's Fold Fields (full example)

```python
# DO — ONE shared serde owns encode+decode of the fold fields; EVERY signed-model serializer
#      routes through it, so no serializer can silently drop a field on round-trip.
# delegation_fold_serde.py  (the single source of truth — real exports: serialize_fold_fields / deserialize_fold_fields)
_FOLD_FIELDS = ("constraints", "resource_limits", "scope", "multi_sig", "multi_sig_policy")
def serialize_fold_fields(rec) -> dict:
    out = {}
    for f in _FOLD_FIELDS:
        v = getattr(rec, f, None)
        if v is not None:                         # prune-when-unset → legacy byte-neutral (Rule 4d pattern)
            out[f] = v
    return out
def deserialize_fold_fields(payload: dict) -> dict:
    return {f: payload[f] for f in _FOLD_FIELDS if f in payload}

# every serializer (chain/store, W3C-VC, JWT, UCAN) calls the SAME two functions:
def _serialize_delegation(rec) -> dict:
    return {"signing_payload_version": rec.signing_payload_version, **serialize_fold_fields(rec)}

# DISCRIMINATING end-to-end regression — FULLY-CONFIGURED record + BOTH polarities (real store API: store_chain / get_chain).
# A legacy/all-unset record round-trips an EMPTY fold dict and asserts nothing — it is an inert tripwire.
@pytest.mark.regression
async def test_v3_delegation_fold_fields_are_load_bearing_after_store_round_trip():
    store = SqliteTrustStore(tmp_path / "t.db")           # REAL store, not a fixture dict
    # chain_with_v3_multisig_delegation populates EVERY fold-field type (constraints/resource_limits/
    # scope/multi_sig/multi_sig_policy) — a configured record is what makes the pin discriminating.
    await store.store_chain(chain_with_v3_multisig_delegation, expires_at)
    await store.get_chain(agent_id)                       # reload from the real persistence path
    assert (await ops.verify_delegation_chain(agent_id)).valid is True   # positive pole; FALSE before the fix
    # NEGATIVE pole — the field is load-bearing ONLY if stripping it flips verify FALSE:
    tampered = strip_fold_field(chain_with_v3_multisig_delegation, "scope")
    await store.store_chain(tampered, expires_at)
    await store.get_chain(agent_id)
    assert (await ops.verify_delegation_chain(agent_id)).valid is False   # strip → fail-closed

# STRUCTURAL serializer-set-parity backstop — enumerate the set by a NON-CIRCULAR predicate:
def test_every_delegation_serializer_routes_through_the_shared_serde():
    # NON-CIRCULAR: discover by "accepts a chain/DelegationRecord and returns a serialization dict",
    # enumerated INDEPENDENTLY of serde imports — a predicate keyed on "imports the serde" can only
    # find compliant functions, never the re-implementing dropper that IS the defect.
    for fn in _functions_returning_delegation_dict():     # AST-walk on signature+return, not import list
        assert _routes_through(fn, "delegation_fold_serde"), f"{fn} re-implements instead of delegating"

# CROSS-VERSION non-collidability — the invariant that keeps a field-strip fail-closed ACROSS versions,
# which the within-version negative pole above does NOT exercise. Per NEW signing_payload_version ship
# one such pin per prior version it could be downgraded to (n−1 pairs); the single re-tag below is ONE pair:
@pytest.mark.regression
async def test_stripped_field_re_tagged_to_other_version_fails_closed():
    rec = strip_fold_field(chain_with_v3_multisig_delegation, "scope")
    rec = retag_signing_version(rec, "legacy-python-v0")  # flip discriminator to a would-be colliding pre-image
    await store.store_chain(rec, expires_at); await store.get_chain(agent_id)
    assert (await ops.verify_delegation_chain(agent_id)).valid is False   # non-collidable → fail-closed

# DO NOT — a serializer that carries only the version tag and DROPS the fold fields
def _serialize_delegation(rec) -> dict:
    return {"signing_payload_version": rec.signing_payload_version}      # constraints/scope/multi_sig gone
# → reload reconstructs a delegation WITHOUT the fold fields → re-derived pre-image differs →
#   verify FALSE. Every per-serializer unit test passes (it only round-trips fields IT knows);
#   the break is visible ONLY at an end-to-end store round-trip / the holistic post-multi-wave redteam.
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "Each serializer's own round-trip test passes" (it round-trips only the fields that serializer emits — it cannot see a field it never wrote)
- "The version tag is enough to reconstruct the record" (the fold fields ARE the signed pre-image; dropping them breaks verify, not just shape)
- "One serializer is the primary path; the interop encoders are rarely used" (the security.md Multi-Site Plumbing failure mode — the rare sibling ships the exact break)
- "I'll re-implement the field list in each serializer" (N copies drift; one shared serde is the Pre-Encoder Consolidation fix)
- "The per-shard redteam was clean" (per-shard reviews see only their own serializer's diff; the cross-serializer gap needs the holistic round)
- "The regression asserts verify TRUE, that's coverage" (an all-unset/legacy record round-trips an empty fold dict and would still pass if every serializer dropped every field — the pin is INERT without a configured record AND a negative pole)
- "A manual grep confirmed every serializer routes through the serde" (manual grep is the exact human-completeness step the originating defect escaped; a mechanical serializer-set-enumeration parity test is the required backstop, not a one-time grep)

The defect polarity is the mirror of Rule 4d: 4d = a field ADDED changes the not-set pre-image (fix: prune-when-unset); 4e = a field ALREADY folded is DROPPED by one serializer on round-trip (fix: one shared serde wired into every path + an end-to-end round-trip pin). Both are byte-for-byte cross-SDK contract breaks the within-serializer suite cannot catch.

Evidence: kailash-py #1841 (kailash 2.59.0, 2026-07-20) — `TrustLineageChain._serialize_delegation` (chain.py) carried `signing_payload_version` but omitted the v2/v3 fold fields across chain-store + W3C-VC + JWT + UCAN; a v2/v3 delegation lost fold fields on store round-trip → verify FALSE → v2/v3 signing non-functional end-to-end. The HIGH was caught by a HOLISTIC post-multi-wave `/redteam` (the per-shard reviews structurally could not see it), reproduced against a REAL `SqliteTrustStore` before the fix, and closed via a shared `delegation_fold_serde.py` wired into all four serializers (prune-when-unset legacy byte-neutral; a `typing.Protocol` broke the CodeQL-flagged import cycle between the serde module and `chain.py`).

## Rule 6 — Public-Artifact Private-Repo Reference (full example)

```markdown
# DO — public artifact names the SDK by role, keeps the bare number

CHANGELOG: "Aligned the trace-event fingerprint with the Rust SDK (parity vector #598)."

# DO NOT — public artifact names the private repo / org / crate-path / qualified issue

CHANGELOG: "Aligned with <private-org>/kailash-rs#598 (bindings/kailash-rs/test-vectors/…)."
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:** "the repo name is public knowledge anyway" / "the CHANGELOG needs the exact cross-ref to be useful" / "it's only the org slug, not a customer name" / "the crate path documents where the vector lives" / "we'll scrub it before the next public release".

Public artifacts (PyPI/crates long-description, README, CHANGELOG) are indexed by every registry, search engine, and downstream consumer; a private-repo-qualified reference is a permanent, correlatable breadcrumb to the private Rust SDK's existence, org, and internal layout — the Foundation-Independence (Directive 0) + `#255`/`#260` no-private-identifiers fence.

Evidence: #1487 / #1488 (2026-07-02) — CHANGELOG (27 refs) + README (3 bare refs) genericized after a repo-path correction surfaced the private org in public-reaching artifacts.
