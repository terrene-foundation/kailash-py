## 🚀 v0.4.0 Enterprise Middleware Architecture

**🌉 Complete Middleware Stack**: Production-ready enterprise platform with `create_gateway()` - single function creates full app with real-time communication, AI chat, and session management.

**🔄 Real-time Agent-UI Communication**: WebSocket/SSE streaming, dynamic workflow creation from frontend, multi-tenant session isolation.

**🤖 AI Chat Integration**: Natural language workflow generation, context-aware conversations, automatic workflow creation from user descriptions.

**⚡ Unified Runtime**: LocalRuntime includes async + all enterprise capabilities. See [developer/18-unified-runtime-guide.md](developer/18-unified-runtime-guide.md) for complete guide.

**🔗 Dot Notation Mapping**: Access nested node outputs with `"result.data"`, `"result.metrics"`, `"source.nested.field"` in workflow connections.

**🎯 Auto-Mapping Parameters**: NodeParameter supports `auto_map_primary=True`, `auto_map_from=["alt1"]`, `workflow_alias="name"` for automatic connection discovery.

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions First

**⚠️ STOP! Before building any app, make these critical decisions:**

### 📋 Decision Matrix → [decision-matrix.md](decision-matrix.md)

The decision matrix provides fast answers to:
- **Workflow Pattern**: Inline vs Class-based vs Hybrid construction
- **Interface Routing**: MCP vs Direct calls vs Hybrid routing
- **Performance Strategy**: Latency thresholds and optimization approaches
- **Common Combinations**: Recommended patterns for different app types

## 🤖 Critical Workflow

**MANDATORY STEPS before any app implementation:**

1. **ALWAYS load [decision-matrix.md](decision-matrix.md) FIRST**
2. **Ask user performance requirements** (latency/throughput/volume)
3. **Ask about LLM agent integration needs**
4. **Use decision matrix lookup tables** to choose patterns
5. **Reference [../apps/ARCHITECTURAL_GUIDE.md](../apps/ARCHITECTURAL_GUIDE.md)** for implementation
6. **Document architectural choices in implementation plan**
7. **Surface trade-offs to user for approval**

### Planning Template:
```
Based on your requirements, I recommend:

Performance Analysis:
- Expected latency: [X]ms
- Request volume: [X]/second
- LLM integration: [Y/N]

Architectural Decisions:
- Workflow pattern: [inline/class-based/hybrid] because [reason]
- Interface routing: [MCP/direct/hybrid] because [reason]
- Performance strategy: [approach] because [reason]

Trade-offs:
- [List key trade-offs and implications]

Proceed with this approach?
```

**Key Decision Points:**
- **<5ms + >1000req/sec** = Direct calls likely needed
- **LLM integration required** = MCP routing essential
- **Mixed complexity** = Hybrid approach recommended
- **Unsure** = Start with MCP routing + hybrid workflows
